1. GoGLL V3.0.3 is the first version with a generated FSA scanner and GLL parser.
1. GoGLL V3.0.2 (worktree gogll-v3.1) accepts a grammar that defines both syntax rules for a parser and
lexical rules for a scanner and generates a parser and a scanner. GoGLL v3.0.2 still has
a hand-written scanner.
1. GOGLL v3.0.1 (worktree gogllv3.00) features a GoGLL parser generated by GoGLL v3.0.0 and a hand-written
FSA lexer. It is used to bootstrap the GoGLL V3.0.2 which generates both a linear-time FSA 
lexer for a matching GLL parser.
1. GoGLL v3.0.0 (worktree gogll-lex). This is the basic bootstrap version of GoGLL v3. 
This version is made with Gocc and generates syntax-only GoGLL v3.0.1 parser.

1. follow is generated as separate functions, not a map of functions.

## 2019-09-10 v2.0.0
1. Bug fixed in `ast.NewAnyOf` and `ast.NewNot`
1. Grammar change: `emptyAlt` replace by `empty`. `emptyAlt` was a vestige of 
the bootstrap gocc compiler.
