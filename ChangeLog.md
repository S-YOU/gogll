1. v3.0.2 generates a GoGLL parser with a matching linear-time FSA lexer from one input grammar.

# 2020-04-22
1. GOGLL v3.0.1 features a GoGLL parser generated by GoGLL v3.0.0 and a hand-written
FSA lexer. It is used to bootstrap the GoGLL v3.0.2 which generates both a linear-time FSA 
lexer for a matching GLL parser.

# 2020-04-17 
1. GoGLL v3.0.0 (worktree gogll-lex). This is the basic bootstrap version of GoGLL v3. 
This version is made with Gocc and generates syntax-only GoGLL v3.0.1 parser.

## 2019-09-10 v2.0.0
1. Bug fixed in `ast.NewAnyOf` and `ast.NewNot`
