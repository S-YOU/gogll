# Readme

This is gogll V1: a generalised LL (GLL) parser generator. This bootstrap version has a gocc generated lexer and parser. The next version will be a scannerless parser generated by this version of gogll.

This version generates GLL parsers for standard BNF grammars according to [Scott and Johnstone 2016](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/structuring-the-gll-parsing-algorithm-for-performance(a95fc020-9918-4f17-a87a-845e2aee12b8).html).

The next version will evolve towards supporting EBNF grammars as described in [Scott and Johnstone 2018](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/gll-syntax-analysers-for-ebnf-grammars(58d1ec5e-28df-486a-879e-36d58a9f8abf).html).
