# Gogll
Gogll generates scannerless, clustered nonterminal parsers (CNP) following [Scott et al 2019](#Scott-et-al-2019). CNP is a version of generalised LL parsing (GLL)[Scott et al 2016](#Scott-et-al-2016). GLL parsers can parse all context free (CF) languages.

# Benefits and disadvantages
The following table compares GLL parsers with LL-k/LR-k parsers and [PEGs](#Ford-2004)

|| GLL | LL-k/LR-k  | PEG
|---|---|---|---|
General CF grammars | Yes | No | No
Composable CF grammars | Yes | No | No
Handle ambiguity | Yes | No | No
Indirect left recursion | No problem | Bad | Bad
Speed (time to compile `gogll.md`) | 1.289 s | 0.040 s | -

* General CF grammars allow the parser developer to write grammars that match the language most naturally.
* Composability allows pre-existing grammar modules to be imported.
* GLL produces a forest of all valid parses of a string. This provides a more systematic basis for disambiguation than k>1 lookahead and solves the problem of PEGs that hide ambiguity by selecting the first valid parse.
* Operator precedence can be implemented very easily by disambiguating the parse forest [[Afroozeh et al 2013](#Afroozeh-et-al-2013), [Basten & Vinju 2019](Basten-2012)].

But

* Most non-trivial context free grammars will generate ambiguous parsers, requiring explicit disambiguation.
* A scannerless GLL parser is slower than the equivalent LR1 parser. See the performance figures for compiling `gogll.md` in the table above. I expect to improve the performance of gogll but GLL parsers are likely to remain significantly slower than equivalent LL-1/LR-1 parsers.
* GLL parsers are worst-case cubic in time and space complexity. The LL-1 parts of the grammar have linear complexity.


# Input Symbols, Markdown Files
Gogll accepts UTF-8 input strings. 
A gogll parser has two parse functions: 
* `Parse(I []byte) []*ParseError`
* `func ParseFile(fname string) []*ParseError`   
If `fname` ends with `.md` the parser ignores all text outside the markdown code blocks delimited by triple backticks. See [gogll.md](gogll.md) for an example.

# Gogll Grammar
Gogll v1 has a BNF grammar. See [gogll.md](gogll.md)


# Status
* `gogll v0` was a bootstrap compiler implemented by a [gocc](https://github.com/goccmack/gocc) lexer and parser.
* `gogll v0` was used to compile `gogll v1`.
* `gogll v0` is currently used to compile a proprietary a query language.
* `gogll v1` compiles itself
* The query language mentioned above is being migrated to `gogll v1`.
* `gogll v1` is currently being used to implement a proprietary GUI definition language.

`gogll v1` is actively being developed.

# Features considered for for future implementation
1. EBNF grammar support [Scott et al 2018](#Scott-et-al-2018)

# Documentation
At the moment this document and the [gogll grammar](gogll.md) are the only documentation. Have a look at 
`gogll/examples/ambiguous` for a simple example and also for simple disambiguation.

Alternatively look at `gogll.md` which is the input grammar and also the grammar
from which the `parser` for this version of `gogll` was generated. `gogll/da` disambiguates the parse forest for an input string.
